Projects __________________________________________________________________________
Role: Analyst, Tech Mahindra Business Services
Current Project: MEDALLIA-BOLDCHAT THEME ALIGNMENT, Python (pandas, nltk, sklearn - Naïve Bayes)
• The objective was to map the themes present on the Medallia’s portal across the survey verbatim data and align the same
with BoldChat’s survey data. The challenge was there were multiple themes assigned to surveys. So, this was a Multi-Label
Multi-Class classification problem.
• The objective was to prepare multiple classification models that would categorize the survey verbatim and those models
trained, would help predict multiple themes for a single survey which would then be mapped against BoldChat’s surveys.
• Approach: Clean the text data using various methods of the NLTK/textblob library, create custom methods for correcting
spelling mistakes, preparing word list dictionary and n-grams, and finally creating a Document Term Matrix from the
corpus with the help of TfidfVectorizer which was passed to the Naïve Bayes classification model.

CHANGE OF TARIFF (UPGRADES), Python (pandas, sklearn - kNN)
• The objective is to identify customers who are likely to upgrade their tariff by creating a predictive model, trained on the
customer demographics, usage, history of interactions and other derived attributes and also providing the probability rate
and likelihood of the customer opting for upgrade.
• The customers thus identified will be converted through various campaigns which will help with the uplift in margin for
the organization.
• Approach: Building project specific data mart, EDA, under-sampling data, developing a pipeline with sklearn for
preprocessing/data wrangling and model building along with cross-validation, model evaluation, tweaking, deploying.
SPEECH ANALYTICS, Python (pydub, ffmpeg, SpeechRecognition)
• The aim of this project was to transcribe the speech of the advisor and the customer into text and then further do the
speaker diarization for the same.
• Approach: Converted the ‘.au’ audio files to ‘.wav’ files and split the large audio files into smaller chunks so as to pass it to
Google’s method of the Recognizer() class from speech_recognition module for conversion of speech to text.
• This helped the Quality Monitoring Team in making the audit process faster and thus requiring a smaller number of FTE’s
for the given task.
SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYTICS, Python (pyquery, requests, BeautifulSoup, textblob, TensorFlow, Transformers)
• Developed scrapers for social media websites like Twitter and Trustpilot for scraping the tweets and reviews about the
client and the competitors, developed sentiments analysis modules for the same as well as Word Clouds for better
visualization.
• Deployed this on the AWS EC2 Instance so that the data could be fetched at a scheduled time and the dashboard hosted
on the internal server can be updated accordingly.
NEXT BEST ACTION, Python (pandas, nltk, textblob, sklearn - Naïve Bayes)
• The objective was to prepare an NLP based classification model that would categorise the type of text data received on
real time basis and give the advisor suggestions as to what next steps should be taken.
• Approach: Clean the text data using various methods of the NLTK library as well as create custom methods for correcting
spelling mistakes, preparing word list dictionary and n-grams, and finally creating a Document Term Matrix from the
corpus with the help of CountVectorizer which was passed to the Naïve Bayes classification model.
UK MOBILE MARKET WATCHDOG, Python (selenium, AWS EC2 Instance)
• Developed scrapers for various telecommunication websites in the UK with the help of selenium and extracted fields
related to price plans which helped with the tariff comparison and deployed these scrapers on AWS EC2 Instance so that
the data could be fetched at a scheduled time and the dashboard hosted on the internal server can be updated
accordingly.
Role: Management Trainee, Tech Mahindra Business
CUSTOMER PHONE BILL - PDF SCRAPING, Python (PyPDF2, re, os, zipfile)
• The objective was to scrape the phone billing information of customers from unstructured pdf files stored in zip archives,
transform it into a structured form and load the information thus scraped to the SQL Server database.
ATTRITION PROJECT ETL, Python (sqlalchemy, pyodbc, win32com)
• The aim of this project was to build an entire pipeline for automating the process of building a data mart for the Employee
Attrition Project right from extracting the spreadsheets from Microsoft Outlook to transforming it into the required
format and finally loading it to the SQL Server database.
